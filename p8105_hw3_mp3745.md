# Problem 1

``` r
# Download data
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

instacart = instacart %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

The instacart dataset consists of 1384617 observations of 15 variables.
The data consists of information regarding orders and the items that
were included. In total, there are 131209 orders recorded in the data.

## Distribution of order sizes

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(order_id) %>% 
  summarize(
    order_size = n()
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = order_size)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80)
  )
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

It looks like the vast majority of orders have less than 20 items.

## Orders by day of week

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(
    order_count = n_distinct(order_id)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    order_dow = recode(
      order_dow, 
      "0" = "Sunday", 
      "1" = "Monday", 
      "2" = "Tuesday", 
      "3" = "Wednesday", 
      "4" = "Thursday", 
      "5" = "Friday",
      "6" = "Saturday"
    )
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| order\_dow | order\_count |
| :--------- | -----------: |
| Sunday     |        27465 |
| Monday     |        19672 |
| Tuesday    |        16119 |
| Wednesday  |        15687 |
| Thursday   |        15959 |
| Friday     |        17406 |
| Saturday   |        18901 |

Unsurprisingly, we can see that most orders from instacart are placed on
Sunday.

## Most popular aisles

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    item_count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(item_count)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Top 10 aisles by number of items ordered")
```

    ## Selecting by item_count

| aisle                         | item\_count |
| :---------------------------- | ----------: |
| fresh vegetables              |      150609 |
| fresh fruits                  |      150473 |
| packaged vegetables fruits    |       78493 |
| yogurt                        |       55240 |
| packaged cheese               |       41699 |
| water seltzer sparkling water |       36617 |
| milk                          |       32644 |
| chips pretzels                |       31269 |
| soy lactosefree               |       26240 |
| bread                         |       23635 |

Top 10 aisles by number of items ordered

There are 134 different aisles that items can be ordered from. The fresh
vegetables aisle has the most items ordered from it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    item_count = n()
  ) %>% 
  filter(item_count > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, item_count), y = item_count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  xlab("aisle")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_mp3745_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot shows the number of items ordered per aisle for the aisles
with over 10,000 items ordered. Again, we can see that the fresh
vegetables aisle had the most items ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarize(
    item_count = n()
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  mutate(item_count_ranking = min_rank(desc(item_count))) %>%
  filter(item_count_ranking <= 3) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, item_count_ranking) %>% 
  select(-item_count_ranking) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Top 3 items ordered from baking ingredients, dog food car, and packaged vegetables fruits aisles")
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                   | item\_count |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                               |         157 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                                |         140 |
| baking ingredients         | Organic Vanilla Extract                         |         122 |
| dog food care              | Organix Grain Free Chicken & Vegetable Dog Food |          14 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe             |          13 |
| dog food care              | Original Dry Dog                                |           9 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                            |        3324 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                             |        1920 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                             |        1692 |

Top 3 items ordered from baking ingredients, dog food car, and packaged
vegetables fruits aisles

From this table, we can see that light brown sugar, organix grain free
chicken & vegetable dog food, and organic baby spinach were the most
popular items from the baking ingredients, dog food care, and packaged
vegetables fruits aisles, respectively.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_order_hour = round(mean(order_hour_of_day), 0)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    order_dow = recode(
      order_dow, 
      "0" = "Sunday", 
      "1" = "Monday", 
      "2" = "Tuesday", 
      "3" = "Wednesday", 
      "4" = "Thursday", 
      "5" = "Friday",
      "6" = "Saturday"
    )
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "order_dow",
    values_from = "mean_order_hour"
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean hour of day that Coffee Ice Cream and Pink Lady Apples are ordered by day of week")
```

| product\_name    | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
| :--------------- | -----: | -----: | ------: | --------: | -------: | -----: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream |     13 |     15 |      15 |        15 |       15 |     10 |       12 |
| Pink Lady Apples |     12 |     12 |      12 |        14 |       12 |     14 |       12 |

Mean hour of day that Coffee Ice Cream and Pink Lady Apples are ordered
by day of week

From the table we can see that pink lady apples tend to be ordered
earlier in the day compared to coffee ice cream, except for Friday and
Saturday.
